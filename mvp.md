#MVP

Our MVP is a working text based game with minimal effort put into the game design (balance, engagement etc) or stylistic concerns.  Features of this will include: 

1. Working interactions.
2. Components fully fleshed out, but highly unstyled.
3. Basic game cycle and progression.
4. Well tested components and reducers.

This version is the robust and functional skeleton to build off of.
