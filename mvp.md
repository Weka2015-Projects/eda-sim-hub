#MVP

Our MVP is a working text based game with minimal effort put into the game design (balance, engagement etc) or stylistic concerns.  Features of this will include: 

1. Working interactions.
2. Components fully fleshed out, but highly unstyled.
3. Basic game cycle and progression.
4. Well tested components and reducers.

Essentially acting as a skeleton to build around and add features.
